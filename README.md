## Webscapping with Python.

In this beginner firendly project, we use **BeautifulSoup** to extract the data from [this Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davis_Cup_winning_players) on the best Tennis men performers in Davis cup.

And we transform the extracted data to a **Pandas** data frame and before storing/loading it as a csv file and to SQLite database through the Python **Sqlite3** library.
